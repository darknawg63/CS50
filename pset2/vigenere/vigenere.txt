Vigenère’s Cipher: Working out the algorithm

Below is our example from the CS50 specification:

Meet me at the park at eleven am
baco nb ac onb acon ba conbac on
Negh zf av huf pcfx bt gzrwep oz

Step 1.

Let's say, for a given key, we want to match each letter of the unencrypted
message with the corresponding letter of the key. For instance, the first
letter of the message with the first letter of the key and so on...........

The loop in will iterate through each character of the
unencrypted message and map it to the key. The loop will also need to iterate
and reset the key.

for each char "i" in string
  map char "j" in key to that char
  if char j is equal to length of key
    reset j

Iteration 0: Map characters to keys

Iteration 1: Map ascii values of key chars to 0 index

a is ascii 97, base of lowers is 97
ascii - base = n of zero index
